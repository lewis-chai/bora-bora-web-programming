Introduction
For this coursework my partner, Danyaal Rahman, and me had to develop a dynamic web application to promote a holiday home which is available to be rented out. We had to create this using a range of different programming languages such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript and python in order to make a variety of features on our web application.
Advanced Features
One of the features that we are most proud of is the implications of google maps on our home page which shows where our holiday home is located. Majority of this was done by my partner using JavaScript.
Another feature is the calendar that has been implemented into the bookings page. This allows any user of the platform to choose dates for which they wish to rent the property out for, making it a lot easier for them.
In addition we have managed to write a code which allows us to show off two images for each local activity available and also two images for the rooms which are available. This gives a make neater, simpler and easier to navigate design for the page rather than it being clustered with photos.
Problems Encountered
When making the JavaScript code for an image to change we had to do a lot of trial and error before the code worked successfully. This was very time consuming for me, but at the end of it I managed to solve the problem by using an if-else statement which allowed users to alternate between two pictures.
We wrote the code for the bookings page using HTML which meant that we weren’t able to link it to the CSV. We found this out very close to the deadline so we had to rewrite the bookings page in python instead which we struggled with since neither of us have any experience in coding using python.
My partner had problems making a slide show for the home page images, he wanted the pictures to stand out and look appealing so we said it would look best as a slideshow that users could view all the images and navigate through. We were unable to make this happen so we opted for the next best alternative which was a slideshow which scrolls through all the images automatically. This will certainly stand out to our audience as it is an animation, however it doesn’t give the freedom of allowing the user to view whichever image they want. 
Splitting of workload
I was responsible of the creation of the whole local activities page and majority of the JavaScript used.  The local activities page consisted of a lot of HTML and CSS with a fair amount of JavaScript. My partner had chosen to do the home page where he put in the map and a small introduction for users to read about the holiday home and the bookings page which required user input and a calendar. The bookings page was only CSS and HTML whereas the home page was that and a small amount of JavaScript for the map.
